  # There are two deployment strategies: 'blue-green' or 'inplace-update'.
  # Blue green deployments keep two elastic beanstalk environments and always deploy to
  # inactive one, to achieve zero downtime.
  # Inplace-update strategy will only keep one environment, and update the version inplace on
  # deploy. Inplace-update will save resources but will suffer from downtime.
  # (All old environments need be destroyed when you switching between strategies.)
  # Default strategy is 'blue-green'.
  # strategy: blue-green

  # Name of s3 bucket where uploaded application packages will be stored.
  # Note that the string ".packages" will be added as a suffix to your bucket.
  # So, if "thoughtworks.simple" is passed as the bucket name, the actual s3 bucket
  # name will be thoughtworks.simple.packages. Default to application name.
  # package_bucket: my-s3-bucket

  # If phoenix mode is turned 'on', it will terminate the old elastic
  # beanstalk environment and recreate a new one on deploy. For blue-green
  # deployment it will terminate the inactive environment first then
  # recreate it. This is useful to avoid configuration drift and
  # accumulating state on the ec2 instances. Also it has the benefit of
  # keeping your ec2 instance system package upto date, because everytime ec2
  # instance boots up from AMI it does a system update. Default is 'off' but we suggest
  # you override it to 'on' for production environment.
  phoenix_mode: true

  # Specifies the maximum number of versions to keep. Older versions are removed
  # and deleted from the S3 source bucket as well. If specified as zero or not
  # specified, all versions will be kept.  If a version_prefix is given, only removes
  # version starting with the prefix.
  # keep_latest: 200

  # Specifies a prefix to prepend to the version label.
  # This can be useful if you want to use different binaries for different
  # environments.
  # version_prefix:

  # Generating version label for package to be deployed. A readable version label will
  # provide better traceablity of your deployment process.
  # By default setting is:
  # version_label: <%= package_digest %>
  # which means using MD5 digest of the package file. If you deploy using build
  # pipeline tool such as GO, switching to pipline counter is highly suggested to
  # increase the readability. Following example will read pipeline counter from environment
  # variable with a fall back to digest for local deployment:
  # version_label: <%= ENV['GO_PIPELINE_COUNTER'] || package_digest %>


  # Smoke test value should be a piece of ruby code with access to single variable
  # "host_name" -- environment DNS name. Smoke test snippet will be evaluated at
  # the end of the deployment for inplace-update deployment. For blue-green
  # deployment it will run after inactive environment update is completed and before
  # switching over.
  # Defining a smoke test is highly recommended for serious usage. By default we use
  # The simplest one that just be checking server landing page using curl, e.g.
  smoke_test: |
    curl_http_code = "curl -s -o /dev/null -w \"%{http_code}\" http://#{host_name}"
